# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Customer-Tweets


The main aim of this project is it predicts the Sentiment of the customer tweets of the Airline dataset.
The data set contains customers tweets of top 6 airlines of America. 
It is a labelled data set and the sentiments are labelled as positive, negative, neutral.
In this project we defined a deep learning approach to classify the tweet categories.
We use keras (deep learning library) to build the model.


This project had tried different approaches
1. Bag of Words model
2. Using Keras Embedding Layer 
3. Using Pretrained Glove Embeddings.


In this project we have tried different variations of the architectures.
